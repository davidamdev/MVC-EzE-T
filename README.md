## Example

### **Architecture**:

Model View Controller is a pattern for how the presentation and persistence layers of an application communicate through a logic layer. Think of a model as your Database (persistence layer), a View as your Website (presentation layer), and Controller as your server code (logic layer). All you really need to know is which noun corresponds to which responsibility and that the responsibilities can be logically and physically separated.

### **Overview**:

Today you're going to build an MVC Snowboard Shop. Basically, weâ€™re building a generic IMS (inventory management system), that will create, read, update, and delete snowboards. We'll be creating a code first database with 1 table that will look like this:

| ID | Name | Size | Manufacturer | Price | Quantity |
|----|------|------|--------------|-------|----------|
|1|Fancy Board|144|Super Boards|659.95|5|
|2|Fancy Board|159|Super Boards|659.95|5|
|3|Ez Board|144|Super Boards|499.95|10|
|4|Ez Board|144|Super Boards|499.95|10|

## Tutorial

### **Prerequisites**:

This tutorial depends on: vs code, dotnet-ef cli, dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator cli, and .net 6 sdk. The following script automates the onboarding process.

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamdev/MVC-EzE-T/2022/onboarding/onboarding.ps1'))
```

### **.NET 6 MVC**:

Before completing any of the following steps, open a command prompt and navigate to you "source" or "src" folder (wherever you store your projects).

1. #### Create a new project

   - Run `dotnet new -o OnlyBoards.Core` in your previously opened command prompt.

2. #### Install dependencies

   - Change directory to OnlyBoards.Core: `cd OnlyBoards.Core`

   - Run the following commands in you rpreviously opened command prompt:
      - `dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design`
      - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`
      - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
      - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`
      - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`

3. #### First "entity" creation
   - Create a new class in the `Models` folder named `Boards.cs`
   - Add the following code:

```c#
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

public class Boards
{
    [Key]
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Size { get; set; }
    public string Manufacturer { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}
```
4. #### Connect database

5. #### Scaffolding
